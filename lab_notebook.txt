Abel lab notebook / notes

4/1
Finished writing the data imports. Next up we need to get the data processed in some manner. A first guess would be:
-LSP for all.
-Detrending for r/g/t/h
-Eigendecomposition for r/g/t/h
-Sine fitting for r/g/t/h
-Wavelet for r/g/t/h
- Try same for activity but I doubt it works. Might need another method.

4/8
- Worked for all, pretty much. Time to now use wavelets for r/g/t/h/w to assign an
  instantaneous phase and period.
- Probably get wavelets from Daniel's code.
